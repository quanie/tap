# Text Analytics Pipeline (TAP)

This is version 3 of TAP redesigned to use Athanor Server and to provide a GraphQL interface for AWA3.

TAP is the server side code for a full stack: [AWA](http://awa.uts.edu.au), a web application for Academic Writing Analytics. The application was developed by the [Connected Intelligence Centre](http://utscic.edu.au), with the original software developed by [Andrew Gibson](http://GitHub.com/andrewresearch).
 
 Originally constructed as a REST API, this repo is a re-write of TAP using [Play Framework](https://www.playframework.com), [Sangria GraphQL](http://sangria-graphql.org) and [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql).
